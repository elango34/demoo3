#CREATED IN LOCAL MACHINE
 ##To be uploaded to github
 
this is a local file we need to add to git repo by using init

 If we clone repo from github it has a remote connection so we 
 can easily push by git push origin. 
 
 In this case we don't have origin we need to create it by 
 git remote add origin.
